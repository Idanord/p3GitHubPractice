Chapter One - The Github Learning Curve 

Once upon a time, Will created a repository named P3GitHubPractice in his Idanord github account.
It was a lonely repository, and had nothing in it but a LICENSE.txt file.  Not even a README.txt
file existed in this lonely place.  
Andrew then created this file name GitHubStory, and we are working on how to get this file into 
Will's repository.

Stay tuned for chapter 2!

Chapter Two

After a few days of issues Will was able to clone the repository from Andrews account. When he was done with his work he pushed it back up into the master on his own account.
