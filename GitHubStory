Chapter One - The Github Learning Curve - The initial branch

Once upon a time, Will created a repository named P3GitHubPractice in his Idanord github account.
It was a lonely repository, and had nothing in it but a LICENSE.txt file.  Not even a README.txt
file existed in this lonely place.   That was soon change, as Andrew was first up to contribute, and
performed these steps:
1) Forked the repository created by Will into his own repository (wallina2018/p3GitHubPractice)
2) Created a file named GitHubStory.txt in the master branch of this forked repository.
3) Created a pull request to Will's repository to notify him that a file is ready to be merged.

Chapter Two

After a few days of issues Will was able to clone the repository from Andrews account. When he was done with his work he pushed it back up into the master on his own account.
