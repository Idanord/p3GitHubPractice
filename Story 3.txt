Chapter One

One day in my Kindergarten class a mother brought her son paying a visit. 
Mom talked with me, said, she was looking a transfer school for his son.

Chapter Two

I thought that would be nice to have a new student in the class.

Chapter Three

The new student fit in quite well, and he brought a dog to school the first
day.    It was a talking dog, and everyone was happy to meet Clifford.
